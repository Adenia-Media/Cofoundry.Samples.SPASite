    TODO: Doc template files in netcore (in summary: templates now use razor proper, but with a fake request context).

    Template view files can be placed in your website views directory which gives you better
    syntax highlighting in VS2017, but this example demonstrates how you can keep them organized
    in your domain layer.

    To use these embedded view files you need to give them a build action of 'Embedded Resource' in
    the properties panel and include a class that implements IAssemblyResourceRegistration in this
    assembly.

    More info here: https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry/wiki/Mail

    For a simpler (non-embedded resource) example see https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/Cofoundry.Samples.SimpleSite
