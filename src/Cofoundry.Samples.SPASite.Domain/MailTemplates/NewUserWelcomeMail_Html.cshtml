    Templates are rendered using RazorEngine, which give us the important
    benefit of being able to render razor templates outside of an http request.
    Unfortunately this means that many MVC specific APIs are not available. The
    Cofoundry EmailTemplateBase includes a couple of extra helpers to bridge this gap.

    Template view files can be placed in your website views directory which gives you better
    syntax highlighting in VS2015, but this example demonstrates how you can keep them organized
    in your domain layer.

    To use these embedded view files you need to give them a build action of 'Embedded Resource' in
    the properties panel and include a class that implements IAssemblyResourceRegistration in this
    assembly.

    For a simpler (non-embedded resource) example see https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/Cofoundry.Samples.SimpleSite
